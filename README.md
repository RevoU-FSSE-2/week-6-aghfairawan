# Docker üêã

Docker makes development efficient and predictable

Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development ‚Äì desktop and cloud. Docker‚Äôs comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

## Docker Image

A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.

## Docker Container

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

# üî® Installing Docker

More detailed download and install instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

After done installing the Docker you can see with running `docker --version` on `CMD`, result :

 # ‚öôÔ∏è Dockerizing a Node.js web app
## Create the Node.js app

```bash
    {
    "name": "docker_web_app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Node.js on Docker",
    "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
    "main": "server.js",
    "scripts":{
      "start": "node server.js"
    },
    "dependencies":{
      "express": "^4.18.2"
    }
  }
```
With your new package.json file, run `npm install`. If you are using npm version 5 or later, this will generate a `package-lock.json` file which will be copied to your Docker image.

Then, create a `server.js` file that defines a web app using the Express.js framework:

```bash
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = 3001;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

## Create a Dockerfile

Open `Dockerfile` in your text editor

First thing we need to do is define  from what image we want to build from. Here we will use the latest version `18` of `node` available from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

```bash
FROM node:18
```
Next we create a directory to hold the application code inside the image, this will be the working directory for your application:

```bash
# Create app directory
WORKDIR app
```
This image comes with Node.js and NPM already installed so the next thing we need to do is to install your app dependencies using the `npm` binary. Please note that if you are using `npm` version 4 or earlier a `package-lock.json` file will not be generated.


```bash
# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --omit=dev
```

To bundle your app's source code inside the Docker image, use the COPY instruction:

```bash
# Bundle app source
COPY . .
```

Your app binds to port `3001` so you'll use the EXPOSE instruction to have it mapped by the `docker` daemon:

```bash
EXPOSE 3001
```

Define the command to run your app using CMD which defines your runtime. Here we will use node server.js to start your server:

```bash
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```
Your Dockerfile should now look like this:

```bash
FROM node:18

# Create app directory
WORKDIR app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

## Building your image
Go to the directory that has your `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image. The `-t` flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later using the `docker images` command:

`docker build . -t <your username>/node-app`

Your image will now listed by Docker 

```bash
$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
node_app     latest    d0383c2bc8e4   59 minutes ago   1.1GB
```
## Run the image

Running your image with `-d` runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The `-p` flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 node_app
```

## Test
To test your app, get the port of your app that Docker mapped:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
3b29bc5ff94d   node_app   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   20 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:3001->3001/tcp   lucid_shockley

```

Then you can open the app on the port you have created in localhost.

# Closing
 Thaks for comming. I hope you learned a thing or more  about Docker. If you found anything the be incomplete, poorly explained, or just trash. feel free to open an issue abaout it.
